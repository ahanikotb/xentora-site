**Before:** Inconsistent results with lead generation.
**After**: landed their first retainer client in the first month and got on 10 sales calls.
**Timeframe**: 1 month
**Intro:**
The goal of this presentation is to show you how to get 1-2 inbound leads per week on LinkedIn without having a lot of followers or spending hours writing content
This is for you if you currently run a Recruiting Firm, Marketing Agency, Lead Generation Agency, Or any remote service-based digital marketing business, and you struggle with keeping your calendar full of qualified sales calls.
This is not for people who have 0 experience or understanding of marketing, business, sales, or software.
This is also not for lazy people, people who make excuses, or the ones who think "work" is just a four-letter word.
**The Truth:**
Most of the people who try to book meetings for their business focus on the short term only.
They only do outreach and completely neglect the long-term game when it comes to client acquisition,
This manifests in many ways …..
If someone is interested and doesn’t book a meeting it ends there, if someone gets on a demo and doesn’t buy it also ends there.
So If you are closing 25% of your booked calls, that means you are wasting the other 75% percent of the valuable leads you invested money and effort in.
So how do we fix this leaky bucket and actually optimize for a healthier more long-term growth strategy while still prioritizing revenue?
We need to create a profile funnel on social media and use it to get in front of our clients and then use AI to nurture them by automating genuine interactions.

It’s really important to qualify them before going on a meeting so use the following script.
**Purpose**
●  Are they actually a good fit?
●  Creating dissonance between where they’re at & where they want to be.
●  Creating urgency
●  Showing authority ## Qualify
●  Sure bro! More than happy to talk with you about what we have to offer.
●  We got a bunch of different stuff, tho…
a. It’s all really customized to what’s best for the clients!
●  How about we start by getting an idea of where you are at and where you wanna go?
a. Cool!
●  Cool, so what is it that you’re looking for? What do you want to achieve?
a. Gotcha!
●  What do you feel is missing to get there right now?
a. Yeah… We hear this all the time..
●  Well - do you have a plan to fix this right now or is this why you reached out in the first place? Lol ## Urgency
●  Cool, cool - so what we have maybe works for you, but always gotta ask
a. Is handling this a priority or more of a “get to it eventually” sort of a thing? ## Proposal
●  Alright - Well, I’d like to go a little deeper with you.
●  If I set up some time to chat, would you wanna talk on the phone XYZ or XYZ, 6pm?
●  Awesome - I’ll send you an invite.
●  Here’s a link to my application form - please fill that out for me real quick so I can prepare our call.
●  Oh… And make sure to check out the units tab in our free group - there’s a cool training about XYZ…
●  And here’s a link to a page of mine where I got some client trainings that might be interesting for you! (TANK page)
 \***\* ## Handling remorse
●  Before the actual call, send more social proof
○  Hey just got this from a client…
○  Screenshot
○  Had to share…
○  Excited to rock n roll ## Confirming attendance
●  24hr before the call
○  Excited for our call tomorrow :)
●  1-4hr before
Thrilled to rock n’ roll with you in a little bit! # Phase 5 (Bonus) : 2 Step Posts.
2 steps posts are so powerful to get prospects to raise their hands to enter sales conversation and move them down the funnel.
Make an asset that is so valuable to your audience, and ask them to comment/dm 1 one letter word to receive it.
Don’t use these a lot as they tend to burn out your audience.

   **Summary and next steps:**
   As you can see, there are so many ways to get clients and not just one, and all you have to do is create a system.
   A good outbound strategy is to make cold email the base and supplement with linkedin ai avatars + grow your profile as an asset.
   You can do it alone, which is extremely slow & hard since you’ll spend months learning the small nuances through trial & error (took me 1.5 years).
   Or you can work personally with me & my team
   If you work with us, you’ll get results faster while making fewer mistakes.
   You’ll be able to start your first campaign in 30 days
   If you don’t get 10 sales calls in the first month after your campaign, don't pay.
   You’ll get our exact systems for positioning your offer, building your funnel, getting meetings, closing clients.
   We’ll set you up with a system that works for 1 year so you’ll get 10 meetings per month.
   We’ll also show you exactly how to reply to interested clients to book meetings
   We’ll also help you post content that gives you authority and makes you a thought leader in your industry and content that get clients dming you asking for your service
   **This is not a course or a community.**
   **This is a completely done for you service and system setup.**
   The spots are limited, so if you want to work with me & my team, book a call below.
