        but I was always frustrated with not being able to get more business
        when the refferals and opportunities slowed down,

        It used to seriously trouble me. I was always worried about where my
        next client was coming from. so after researching everything i could i
        got started with COLD EMAILING. a way to message business owners you
        dont know and get them to book a call with you to discuss business. then
        i discovered you can show them a video before they book a call with you
        so they can get to know you and your business. and be presold before
        ever talking to you.
